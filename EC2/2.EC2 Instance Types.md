- Balance between:
	- Compute
	- Memory
	- Networking

### Compute Optimized
- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
	- Media transcoding
	- High performance web server
	- Dedicated gaming servers
	- Machine learning
	- etc

### Memory Optimized 
- When processing large data sets in memory
- Use cases:
	- High performance, relational/non-relational databases
	- Distributed web scale cache stores

### Storage Optimized
- when requiring high, sequential read/write access to large ata sets on local storage
- Use cases:
