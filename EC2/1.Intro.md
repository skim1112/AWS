Infrastructure as a Service

It mainly consists in the capability of:
- Renting virtual machines(EC2)
- Storing data on virtual drives(Elastic Block Storage)
- Distributing load across machines(Elastic Load Balancer)
- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group(Auto Scaling Group)


### EC2 Sizing & Configuration options
- OS
- CPU
- RAM
- Storage Space:
	- Network-attached(EBS & EFS)
	- Hardware(EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card: Speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules: **Security Group**
- Bootstrap script(Configure at first launch): **EC2 User Data**


### EC2 User Data
- possible to bootstrap our instances using an **EC2 User data** script
- **Boostrapping** -> launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is **only run once** at the instance first start
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	- Installing updates
	- Installing software
	- Downloading common files from the internet
	- Anything you can think of
- EC2 user data Script runs with the root user(sudo)
